# The Royal Meats Project

    Royal Meats is a project that i and my friends created for our systems development course.
    The theme of this project is a hamburger shop, in which we use HTML, CSS & JavaScript, and soon we will use more elements and languages on this page.

    With HTML:
    - We create the pages and connect them to each other;
    - We put the links for redirects;
    - And we added the images.
    With CSS:
    - We styled these pages and the images;
    - And we create pseudocodes for further decoration in specific elements.
    With JavaScript:
    - We create the slide carousel;
    - Create the mobile button;
    - Create the menu button and the button to hide the text on about page.

    Any suggestions will be welcome.
